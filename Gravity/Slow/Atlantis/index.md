# Results of models for the Atlantis OTF .

The main transform length is 62 km. Two small transforms on north and south sides are added.

Main Transform Margin length (MTL)=62 km, Half-spreading rate (v_half)=1.2 cm/yr,
so the model ends at 6.46 Ma (=1.25 * MTL / v_half). 

Tested parameter - no hydrothermal cooling

**rheology option**

1. viscous: only dislocation creep (disl.) applies to the model.

2. isoviscous: constant viscosity (10^21 Pas) in the model.
 
3. vp: disl. + plasticity (plas.).

4. vep: disl. + plas. + elasticity (elas.).
